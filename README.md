# The-initial-one
The first try.

A temporary game, coding just for fun(because it's just programmed by C++ and no GUI and GUI is used!)  
The perspective is to make a turn-based game,and players can always use amazing tactics to reverse the game situation.  
As a senior strategy game player, I'm fascinated by its fancy and its infinite possibility, and what's my favorite is analyzing the subtle situation:  
the superior side and the inferior side is not constant, and sometimes an awesome/simple action can totally reverse it!  
That's the initial goal(hope that after my coding level & painting level is uppered,I can really change it to an big game!)
